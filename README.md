## BIO
I live in Spokane, WA & study graphic design at Eastern Washington University.

        Design is really my 2nd career as I did 20 years in the Air Force doing IT called Cyber Systems Operations.
        
        After I retired, it was time to try something new & creative. Now that I'm designing at EWU--I can't wait to graduate!
        
        Creatively, music is a big inspiration. To get motivated I just play my guitars!
        
        Visually, I explore photography so much I plan to use it in freelance work.
        
        Life is so much better with design...
